# Agent Instructions

This project is a TypeScript implementation of a Model Context Protocol server for Roam Research. Source files live under `src/`. Tool definitions and input schemas are in `src/tools`. The main entry point is `src/server/roam-server.ts`.

When modifying TypeScript sources run `npm run build` to compile into the `build/` directory. There are no automated tests. Documentation lives in markdown files at the repository root. Keep new documentation concise and in English unless otherwise requested.

If you add new MCP tools remember to document them in `README.md` and `Functionality.md`.
